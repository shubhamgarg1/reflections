Learned Commands:

	git diff  				 : working directory and staging area
	git diff --staged 		 : staging area and repository
	git diff commit2 commit1 : Difference between two commits of repository.

	git add : Adds the changes done to the staging area from the working directory
	eg git add game.js

	git reset --hard : Eliminate the changes in the working repository and make the file go to the last commit version

	git commit : Add the changes from staging area to repository 
	eg git commit -m "Add color"

	git branch : See the branches and the selected branch
	git branch easy-mode : Creates a easy-mode branch 

	git checkout easy-mode : Makes the present branch as easy-mode, By default current branch is master



What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init is used
	A .git hidden folder is created
	It converts that directory into a git repository


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	staging area contains all the files that we have added using git add that we are going to commit.
	working directory is just the folder we are working in.
	repository refers to the git folder we work in , we are going to commit the changes of staging area to the git repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	 
	 By using git add for only one file and then commit. Now only one file is commited.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	When you want to create a different version of a game (Not only an update)
	Try out new different features but want a working version always available ( You could also checkoutto the working commit )

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
